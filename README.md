# create-current-directory 
## What is this?
+ This extension is serve create new file / folder to your current opened workspace.

## Why make this? VSCode has already that function.
+ Sure, you are correct, but wrong.
+ VSCode has 2type create new file method.
	- one is `File:New Untitled File => File:Save / File:Save As...` but this method needed control OS file system window.
	- other one is move to `Explorer pane` and `File:New File` this method is complete in VSCode window. but you needed multiple cursor + keyboard or keyboard shortcut control for create one file.

+ I think that is redundant. Then i want keyboard and path based create file method.

## How to use?
+ It is simple.
1. Press Cmd+Shift+P(mac) or other way to open Command Palette.
2. Select `create new file` or `create new folder`
3. Type relative file / folder path from current opening file.
4. Done. 

## and useful small functions!
+ change current file name from Command Palette!
